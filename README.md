### Overview

This repository contains:

- An improved version of the wavefront solver in [1], implemented in MATLAB and CUDA:
  - For MATLAB code, simply plug & play.
  - For the CUDA solver, you need an NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA to compile and run. Also refer to [`./cuda/README.md`](./cuda/README.md) for how to compile the code.
- Other solvers [2, 3] (our implementation).
- Scripts and data for generating Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 in the paper.

Our solver is not multi-scale because microscopy wavefronts are small; however based on our solver it is simple to implement such a pyramid scheme.
